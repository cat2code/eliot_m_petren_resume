This is a repo that implements websites on my the personal domain I own "mpetren.se" and first and foremost 
my resume is hosted at the main page "www.mpetren.se". The websites are written in Markdown, built with Jekyll 
and deployed with Github Pages.

mpetren.se - Resume.
mpetren.se/blog - Personal blog posting random stuff from my life. Some posts are tweet-long and some are not. This site collects all posts that I do on the other blog-like sites. 
mpetren.se/code123 - Code blog posting my hobby projects or progress of stuff I try to learn.
mpetren.se/reviews - Review blog grading albums and movies that I like or have other thoughts about that I want to share with the world.
